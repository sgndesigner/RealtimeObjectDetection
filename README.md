# RealtimeObjectDetection
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of real-time object detection using the YOLOv4 deep learning model. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular and efficient approach to object detection that can identify multiple objects in images and video frames simultaneously.

Features:

Real-time object detection using YOLOv4 architecture.
Webcam and video file support for live object detection.
Customizable confidence threshold for accurate object filtering.
Integration of COCO dataset labels for commonly detected objects.
GPU acceleration for enhanced processing speed.
Easy-to-understand code with step-by-step comments and explanations.
Getting Started:

Clone or download the repository.
Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
Load your trained YOLOv4 model weights and configuration.
Customize detection parameters, such as confidence threshold and class labels.
Run the code to perform real-time object detection on webcam or video files.
Contributions:
Contributions and improvements to the project are highly welcome. Feel free to suggest enhancements, fix issues, or add new features via pull requests.

Dependencies:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
TensorFlow (for GPU acceleration)
Explore the exciting world of real-time object detection using YOLOv4 and enhance your computer vision skills. Happy coding!
